"""
HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract) implementations for each chain.

HTLCs enable trustless atomic swaps by ensuring:
1. Funds can only be claimed with knowledge of a secret (preimage)
2. Funds can be refunded after a timeout if not claimed

Each chain has its own HTLC implementation:
- BTC: Native Bitcoin Script (P2WSH)
- M1: BATHRON native via RPC
- EVM: Solidity smart contract

FlowSwap 3-Secret Support:
- btc_3s: BTC HTLC with 3 independent hashlocks
- evm_3s: EVM HTLC3S contract for Base Sepolia
- M1: Native HTLC3S via bathron-cli htlc3s_* commands
